\mainpage GachaTerm Engine Documentation

# Welcome to GachaTerm!

**GachaTerm** is a simple and straightforward gacha game engine written for the terminal, all in C.

It practically reinvents the well: I made my own "graphics library" to render stuff to the terminal like you would in [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/), it's just just simplified and less efficient. The shader library is `gachashade.h`. You can even use the shader library and rendering in non-game projects, if you want to. You are free to do that.
